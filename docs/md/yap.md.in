This manual was written by Vítor Santos Costa, Luís Damas, Rogério Reis, and Rúben Azevedo. The manual is largely based on the DECsystem-10 Prolog User's Manual by D.L. Bowen, L. Byrd, F. C. N. Pereira, L. M. Pereira, and D. H. D. Warren. We have used comments from the Edinburgh Prolog library written by R. O'Keefe. Documentation from many built-ins is originally from the SWI-Prolog manual, with the gracious authorization from Jan Wielemaker. We would also like to gratefully acknowledge the contributions from Ashwin Srinivasian.
