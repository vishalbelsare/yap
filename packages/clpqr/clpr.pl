/** @pred bb_inf(+ _Ints_,+ _Expression_,- _Inf_)
The same as bb_inf/5 but without returning the values of the integers
and with an eps of 0.001.


*/
/** @pred bb_inf(+ _Ints_,+ _Expression_,- _Inf_,- _Vertext_,+ _Eps_)
Computes the infimum of  _Expression_ within the current constraint
store, with the additional constraint that in that infimum, all
variables in  _Ints_ have integral values.  _Vertex_ will contain
the values of  _Ints_ in the infimum.  _Eps_ denotes how much a
value may differ from an integer to be considered an integer. E.g. when
 _Eps_ = 0.001, then X = 4.999 will be considered as an integer (5 in
this case).  _Eps_ should be between 0 and 0.5.


*/
/** @pred dump(+ _Target_,+ _Newvars_,- _CodedAnswer_)
Returns the constraints on  _Target_ in the list  _CodedAnswer_
where all variables of  _Target_ have veen replaced by  _NewVars_.
This operation does not change the constraint store. E.g. in

```
dump([X,Y,Z],[x,y,z],Cons)
```

 _Cons_ will contain the constraints on  _X_,  _Y_ and
 _Z_ where these variables have been replaced by atoms `x`, `y` and `z`.




 */
/** @pred entailed(+ _Constraint_)
Succeeds if  _Constraint_ is necessarily true within the current
constraint store. This means that adding the negation of the constraint
to the store results in failure.


*/
/** @pred inf(+ _Expression_,- _Inf_)
Computes the infimum of  _Expression_ within the current state of the
constraint store and returns that infimum in  _Inf_. This predicate
does not change the constraint store.


*/
/** @pred inf(+ _Expression_,- _Sup_)
Computes the supremum of  _Expression_ within the current state of
the constraint store and returns that supremum in  _Sup_. This
predicate does not change the constraint store.


*/
/** @pred maximize( _V_)
maximise variable  _V_


*/
/** @pred minimize(<tt>V</tt>)
minimise variable  _V_
