  # === Variables ===
  #
  # This module will set the following variables per language in your
  # project, where <lang> is one of C, CXX, or Fortran:
  #
  # ::
  #
  #    MPI_<lang>_FOUND           TRUE if FindMPI found MPI flags for <lang>
  #    MPI_<lang>_COMPILER        MPI Compiler wrapper for <lang>
  #    MPI_<lang>_COMPILE_FLAGS   Compilation flags for MPI programs
  #    MPI_<lang>_INCLUDE_PATH    Include path(s) for MPI header
  #    MPI_<lang>_LINK_FLAGS      Linking flags for MPI programs
  #    MPI_<lang>_LIBRARIES       All libraries to link MPI programs against
  #
  # Additionally, FindMPI sets the following variables for running MPI
  # programs from the command line:
  #
  # ::
  #
  #    MPIEXEC                    Executable for running MPI programs
  #    MPIEXEC_NUMPROC_FLAG       Flag to pass to MPIEXEC before giving
  #                               it the number of processors to run on
  #    MPIEXEC_PREFLAGS           Flags to pass to MPIEXEC directly
  #                               before the executable to run.
  #    MPIEXEC_POSTFLAGS          Flags to pass to MPIEXEC after other flags
  #
  # === Usage ===
  #
  # To use this module, simply call FindMPI from a CMakeLists.txt file, or
  # run find_package(MPI), then run CMake.  If you are happy with the
  # auto- detected configuration for your language, then you're done.  If
  # not, you have two options:
  #
  # ::
  #
  #    1. Set MPI_<lang>_COMPILER to the MPI wrapper (mpicc, etc.) of your
  #       choice and reconfigure.  FindMPI will attempt to determine all the
  #       necessary variables using THAT compiler's compile and link flags.
  #    2. If this fails, or if your MPI implementation does not come with
  #       a compiler wrapper, then set both MPI_<lang>_LIBRARIES and
  #       MPI_<lang>_INCLUDE_PATH.  You may also set any other variables
  #       listed above, but these two are required.  This will circumvent
  #       autodetection entirely.
  #
  # When configuration is successful, MPI_<lang>_COMPILER will be set to
  # the compiler wrapper for <lang>, if it was found.  MPI_<lang>_FOUND
  # and other variables above will be set if any MPI implementation was
  # found for <lang>, regardless of whether a compiler was found.
  #
  # When using MPIEXEC to execute MPI applications, you should typically
  # use all of the MPIEXEC flags as follows:
  #
  # ::
  #
  #    ${MPIEXEC} ${MPIEXEC_NUMPROC_FLAG} PROCS
  #      ${MPIEXEC_PREFLAGS} EXECUTABLE ${MPIEXEC_POSTFLAGS} ARGS
  #
  # where PROCS is the number of processors on which to execute the
  # program, EXECUTABLE is the MPI program, and ARGS are the arguments to
  # pass to the MPI program.
