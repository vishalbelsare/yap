@pred  see(+ _S_)

If  _S_ is a currently opened input stream then it is assumed to be
the current input stream. If  _S_ is an atom it is taken as a
filename. If there is no input stream currently associated with it, then
it is opened for input, and the new input stream thus created becomes
the current input stream. If it is not possible to open the file, an
error occurs.  If there is a single opened input stream currently
associated with the file, it becomes the current input stream; if there
are more than one in that condition, then one of them is chosen.

When  _S_ is a stream not currently opened for input, an error may be
reported, depending on the state of the `file_errors` flag. If
 _S_ is neither a stream nor an atom the predicates just fails.
