/** @pred prolog:goal_expansion( :G,+ M,- NG)
    @pred user:goalexpansion(+ G,+ M,- NG)

The goal_expansion/3 hook  is an user-defined
procedure that is called after term expansion when compiling or
asserting goals for each sub-goal in a clause. The first argument is
bound to the goal and the second to the module under which the goal
 _G_ will execute. If goal_expansion/3 succeeds the new
sub-goal  _NG_ will replace  _G_ and will be processed in the same
 way. If goal_expansion/3 fails the system will use the default
expandion mechanism.

This hook is called:
- at compilation time;
- when running a query in the top-level

Older versions of YAP would call this procedure  at every meta-call.

/** @pred  term_expansion( _T_,- _X_)
    user:term_expansion( _T_,- _X_)


This user-defined predicate is called by `expand_term/3` to
preprocess all terms read when consulting a file. If it succeeds:

+
If  _X_ is of the form `:- G` or `?- G`, it is processed as
a directive.
+
If  _X_ is of the form `$source_location`( _File_, _Line_): _Clause_` it is processed as if from `File` and line `Line`.

+
If  _X_ is a list, all terms of the list are asserted or processed
as directives.
+ The term  _X_ is asserted instead of  _T_.

/** @pred  user:message_hook(+ _Term_, + _Kind_, + _Lines_)


Hook predicate that may be define in the module `user` to intercept
messages from print_message/2.  _Term_ and  _Kind_ are the
same as passed to print_message/2.  _Lines_ is a list of
format statements as described with print_message_lines/3.

This predicate should be defined dynamic and multifile to allow other
modules defining clauses for it too.

/** @pred  exception(+ _Exception_, + _Context_, - _Action_)


Dynamic predicate, normally not defined. Called by the Prolog system on run-time exceptions that can be repaired `just-in-time`. The values for  _Exception_ are described below. See also catch/3 and throw/1.
If this hook preodicate succeeds it must instantiate the  _Action_ argument to the atom `fail` to make the operation fail silently, `retry` to tell Prolog to retry the operation or `error` to make the system generate an exception. The action `retry` only makes sense if this hook modified the environment such that the operation can now succeed without error.

+ `undefined_predicate`
 _Context_ is instantiated to a predicate-indicator ( _Module:Name/Arity_). If the predicate fails Prolog will generate an existence_error exception. The hook is intended to implement alternatives to the SWI built-in autoloader, such as autoloading code from a database. Do not use this hook to suppress existence errors on predicates. See also `unknown`.
+ `undefined_global_variable`
 _Context_ is instantiated to the name of the missing global variable. The hook must call nb_setval/2 or b_setval/2 before returning with the action retry.
